### What I learned

#### Introduction to Tailwind CSS

In this NFT Preview Card project, I explored Tailwind CSS as a utility-first CSS framework. This was my first experience using a CSS framework, and I discovered several valuable benefits and learning points:

##### 1. Utility-First Approach

Tailwind CSS employs a utility-first approach that allowed me to build designs directly in HTML using utility classes. This differs significantly from traditional CSS approaches where we write separate selectors and rules. For example:

```html
<!-- Traditional Approach: Requires writing separate CSS -->
<div class="card">...</div>

<!-- Tailwind Approach: Styling directly in HTML -->
<div
  class="bg-very-dark-blue-card text-white rounded-2xl p-6 max-w-[350px] shadow-2xl">
  ...
</div>
```

This enables faster development without switching between HTML and CSS files.

##### 2. Easy Responsiveness

Tailwind provides an intuitive prefix system (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.) for applying different styles at different screen sizes. Example:

```html
<h1 class="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">Responsive Heading</h1>
```

##### 3. Group Modifier for Interactions

I learned to use Tailwind's `group` and `group-hover` features to create complex interactions like image overlays:

```html
<div class="relative group">
  <img src="image.jpg" class="rounded-lg" />
  <div
    class="absolute inset-0 bg-cyan opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-50 transition-opacity duration-300">
    <img src="icon.svg" class="opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100" />
  </div>
</div>
```

##### 4. Transitions and Animations

Tailwind has excellent utility classes for transitions and animations that make adding interactivity easy:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors duration-300">
  Button with Transition
</button>
```

##### 5. Mobile-First Mindset

Tailwind encourages a mobile-first approach to design, which is a modern practice in responsive web development. I started by designing for mobile devices, then expanded for larger screens.

##### 6. Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements

Tailwind provides an easy way to apply styles to various element states using prefixes like `hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`, etc.

```html
<a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline"
  >Link with Hover Effect</a
>
```
